Easing functions for the google-closure library.

Installation
============

To grab a copy of plovr, make sure you have a valid JDK and ``ant`` installed.
Then run ``get_plovr.sh``. This will install plovr into the subfolder "plovr".
Once installed you can use the ``Makefile`` to build the demo, or run the
plovr dev server.

Before using ``make`` you should fix the plovr folder in the Makefile.

Demo
====

You can look at a live demo over at http://exhuma.github.com/closure
