Repository for my utility code for the google-closure library.

Running the demo
================

In order to run the demo, you need to install the closure library into a
subfolder called "lib". The folder's structure should look like this::

    lib
      +- closure
          +- bin
          +- css
          +- goog
          +- known_issues
      +- third-party

When downloading the library, and looking into it's contents, this should
become clearer.
