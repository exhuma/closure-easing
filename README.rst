Repository for my utility code for the google-closure library.

Running the demo
================

In order to run the demo, you need to install the closure library into a
subfolder called "lib". The folder's structure should look like this::

    lib
      +- closure
          +- bin
          +- css
          +- goog
          +- known_issues
      +- third-party

The shell script "install_closure.sh" will set everything up for you.


.. note::

    The closure library is downloaded using SVN. So you need ``subversion``
    installed to run the installer script!
